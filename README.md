# Welcome to Bamazon!

Bamazon is Amazon-like storefront developed using MySQL and NodeJS. This application will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

# How to Use

To use Bamazon, first download the repository to your computer, then navigate to the folder using the Terminal/Command Prompt. Make sure that MySQL is running on your machine and type: **node bamazonCustomer**.

If done correctly, this command should display the **Bamazon Product Table** where users can browse items, stock, prices, and departments.

Follow the command line prompt by entering the unique item ID for the product you are interested in. Next, Bamazon will ask you how many of the desired product you would like to purchase. After entering a number, Bamazon will automatically check if the item is in stock and if so, will calculate the cost of your items. From this point, the ordered items are removed from stock and the application closes. **Just enter node bamazonCustomer to shop again!**

*This application was developed using **MySQL, NodeJS, & npm***
